# JacobAndEloise
A single dad and his precocious daughter who live in East Scarpe.

REQUIREMENTS:
* Smapi
* Content Patcher
* East Scarpe [Nexus Mod: 5787]

Jacob is a handsome mobile vet. On Tuesdays he travels the valley, going as far as Grampleton and Castle Village to tend to sick or injured animals (note: you cannot join him, these places do not currently exist ingame). He lives in the farm above East Scarpe with his daughter, Eloise.
Jacob is polite, but shy, and awkward when you first meet him. He may come across as a bit rude, but he's just uncomfortable with strangers. 
His daughter, Eloise, is his polar opposite. She talks a LOT. She loves birds and other animals, and attends 'school' with the other kids on Tuesday, Thursday and Friday. On Tuesdays, since Jacob isn't going to leave his daughter at home unattended, she will spend the evening with either Jas or Vincent.
Jacob is not marriageable (although Ellie may try to persuade you!) because he will not leave his daughter alone in a big empty house!
(But I may make him 'datable' if I can persuade someone to code it for me).

CURRENTLY A WORK IN PROGRESS:
- Two sprite sheets and portraits for Eloise
- Sprites and portraits for Jacob
- Dialogue for both (more to come)
